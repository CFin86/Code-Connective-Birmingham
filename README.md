# Welcome to the very first Birmingham Area Code Connective Co-Op
 We're very excited for this to be happening, and we hope to watch each other grow and learn together. A big thanks goes out to TrueCoders and Whiteboard It for hosting us this evening.

### WiFi
This is the info to access the wifi:
* Network Name: "TrueCoders Wifi"
* Password: `4TrueCodersOnly!`

Heres a bunch of free or low cost resources that will probably get brought up or mentioned through out the meet up. I always find it funny that we're in the Information Age, yet it's hard to stay focused on one singular, resource. If you don't get anything else out of this meet up, I hope these 3 suggestions will help you.

1. Make at least one friend tonight that seems to have similar goals as yourself.
2. Pick ONE AND ONLY ONE course.
3. Work through that course together and motivate each other.

[If I could start over from the beginning, this is the one article I wish I would have read before embarking on this coding journey.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/read-search-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-743a23c411b4)

### Browser Tutorials
These are tutorials that are completed in a browser. They're really nifty, and most everyone that I know gets their start through one of these.

1. [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - This will give you the gist of a programming language. It’s great to get your toes wet. There is a ton of hand holding (even with the free form projects), and guided learning, so it really makes new languages approachable.
    * *CodeAcademy is mostly free, but there is a premium option for $19.99 a month or $199 for a guided path.*
2. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - A little less hand holding than CodeAcademy and 100% free this sounds like the perfect combo. However, there is one major drawback. FCC uses an older version of Javascript. Don't get discouraged, there is plenty of crossover from one version to another, so using FCC to learn is excellent. The Algorithm Scripting sections and all of the Development projects are all incredibly awesome.

### Local Environment Tutorials
These are tutorials that you will build locally on your computer within a text editor like [VSCode.](https://code.visualstudio.com/) These are really cool, because you'll actually get to see what your projects look like on a real web browser like Google Chrome.

1. [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/create) - I personally haven’t used it, but [LeAlan Carter, Senior Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lealan-carter-4b405aa8/) at [Remine](http://remine.com/) is a big fan of the course. It's a good mix of video instructions with local projects, lectures with quizzes, and a few in-browser projects. *A Note About LeAlan: If you are ever thinking about giving up, or that you're never going to understand functions, loops, or arrays, [read this blog post he wrote.](http://beardedsquid.blogspot.com/2017/05/how-squids-grow-beards.html)*
    * *Treehouse has a free trial period for seven days, and then $25 a month there after.*
2. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) - One of my personal favorites. Completely free, and has a clear, concise learning path. It relies a lot on personal research, and the material covers several important, but not well documented  topics like Test Driven Development.

### MOOC
A MOOC is a Massive Open Online Course. Typically, there will be some mix of video lectures, slides, and projects. Due to the grand scale (they call it massive for a reason) of these sites, it's really easy to get lost amongst all the courses available, so I'll post links to ones that I have experience in. The quality of these courses is incredible but most of them are not free. Fortunately, there are a few work-arounds to get heavy discounts.

1. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - this is my favorite MOOC. [The full stack web dev course taught by Jogesh Muppala is awesome.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-mobile-app-development) I would  say this was the course that made me have that light-bulb moment where web development started making sense.
    * *Courses range in price from $29-$49 a month however, if you don't care about a certificate you can audit most of the courses for free if you use [this link](https://clearlydecoded.com/you-can-still-take-coursera-courses-for-free)*

2. [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - similar to Coursera, but the platform runs a lot smoother. Listed are the courses that I see mentioned frequently. Both of them have other courses in the web development field, so I would recommend doing the trial version of both, and deciding for yourself which you like better. You'll see that these courses are marked down from the full price of $199.99. DO NOT EVER PAY MORE THAN $20 FOR AN UDEMY COURSE. Seriously, they run specials all the time. Add a course to your cart/wishlist and then leave it over night. It will almost always drop significantly in price.

3. [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) - this is Microsoft's learning platform. It is extraordinarily vast and in depth. I haven't actually found a course that I love and swear by, but

It will give you three months access. When your three months are up, create a new account with a new email; wash, rinse, and repeat.
